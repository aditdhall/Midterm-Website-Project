                    One of the country’s largest urban agglomerations, Delhi sits astride (but primarily on the west bank of) the Yamuna River, a tributary of the Ganges (Ganga) River, about 100 miles (160 km) south of the Himalayas. The national capital territory embraces Old and New Delhi and the surrounding metropolitan region, as well as adjacent rural areas. To the east the territory is bounded by the state of Uttar Pradesh, and to the north, west, and south it is bounded by the state of Haryana.

						<h3>Delhi</h3>
						<p>
                        Delhi, the bustling capital of India makes for one of the perfect travel destinations in India. A city of heritage monuments, teeming bazaars and mouth-watering street food reminding you of its rich past from the Mughal era to a city that is today, more cosmopolitan and contemporary with its sprawling boulevards, high-end malls, shopping complexes and luxury hotels & restaurants; Delhi is for sure, a true amalgamation of age old cultures and present day’s modernization. Be it a stroll through the narrow lanes of ‘Chandni Chowk’ relishing on its lip-smacking chaats, a real shopping fun in the streets of ‘Sarojini Nagar’ or more exotic ‘Delhi Haat’, a heritage walk through the awe-inspiring Mughal architectural masterpieces of ‘Humayun’s Tomb’ and ‘Qutub Minar’, a visit to the 700 years old ‘Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah’, a lovely experience of relishing on some tasty cuisine sitting at a lake side café in the posh ‘Hauz Khas Village’, a memorable time at the lively ‘Kingdom of Dreams’ enjoying a musical Bollywood night, or a picnic time at the iconic ‘India Gate’; the list of ‘must-do things’ in Delhi has no end.
