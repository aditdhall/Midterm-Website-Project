                    Whoever thought grilled chunks of meat or fish marinated in aromatic Indian spices couldn’t give you joy should think again. While we Indians have a lot to be thankful for to the Mughals, Kebabs are one of them. Whether it is Kebabs being delivered to your car, a quintessentially Delhi experience, to food stalls and fine dining restaurants across the city, try this popular dish and you will be hooked forever.

						<h3>Karim's, New Delhi</h3>
						<p>
                        Karim’s is a historic restaurant located near Jama Masjid in Old Delhi. It was established in 1913 and serves Mughal delicacies to its loyal customers to date. In the mid 19th century, Mohammed Aziz was a cook in the royal court of Mughal Emperor at the Red Fort, but he left when the emperor was dethroned. However, Haji Karimuddin, one of Aziz’s son, moved back to Delhi with the aim of opening a dhaba to cater to the people coming to the capital from all over India (sometimes even from Pakistan). Haji Karimuddin started the dhaba by selling just two dishes that include alu gosht (mutton with potatoes) and daal served with Rumali roti. It was in 1913 that Haji Karimuddin established the Karim Hotel in Gali Kababian, near Jama Masjid in Delhi and soon his restaurant earned the name and fame by serving the delicious Royal food to the common man.
