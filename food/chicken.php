                    Butter chicken is cooked in a traditional clay oven or tandoor. It’s first marinated in a mix of spices including cumin, turmeric, garlic and ginger, along with yogurt and lemon juice. A tomato sauce with butter and cream is then poured over it. Time and experimentation have inspired many different versions of the recipe which can be found online, many using a variety of different spices. What you get here is two recipes in one—a traditional tandoori chicken with an added makhani (or butter gravy). The recipe originally made at the Moti Mahal used fewer spices than many of the versions you see today.

                        The owner realized that the Tandoori Chicken hanging on the seekhs above the tandoor all day would tend to dry out if unsold. He then came up with the genius idea of creating a basic gravy with tomatoes, butter, cream and some spices to immerse the Tandoori Chicken pieces in, helping them regain moisture and become palatable again.
                        And thus, was born The Butter Chicken.
