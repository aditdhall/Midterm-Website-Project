                    A Kathi roll is a street-food dish originating from Kolkata, West Bengal. In its original form, it is a skewer-roasted kebab wrapped in a paratha bread, although over the years many variants have evolved all of which now go under the generic name of kati roll. Today, mostly any wrap containing a filling enfolded in an Indian flatbread (roti) is called a kati roll. In native Bengali, the word Kati roughly translates to "Stick", referring to how they were originally made. In Bengal though, the delicacy is simply known as "roll". Kati Rolls normally contain coriander chutney, egg, and chicken but the types may vary. Internationally, specifically in parts of Canada and the United States, kathi roll has become popular fast food found in Indian take-out restaurants.

                        There are multiple Nizam locations in Delhi (as well as a few other in other states), but the Connaught Place shop—not far from the famous ring of colonnaded Georgian buildings, the Janpath Market, and the name-brand retailers—is a particular landmark.
